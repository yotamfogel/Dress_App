The previous AI engineer was tasked with significantly enhancing an existing full-stack clothing detection application. Initially, the core request was to replace the backend's AI with Mask R-CNN (Detectron2) and MMFashion for advanced masking, color, and attribute detection. The engineer successfully refactored the backend into a more modular structure, incorporating a new fashion classification system.

A major challenge encountered was the installation of large AI libraries like Detectron2 and MMFashion, which often failed or ran in the background. Despite these challenges, a robust fallback system was implemented using YOLO and heuristic methods, ensuring the application remained functional while advanced models installed. The AI also addressed Git LFS issues, cleaning the repository.

Subsequently, the user requested explicit AI outputs (clothing type, styles, color percentages) and the ability to handle multiple detected items. This was fully implemented in the backend and integrated into the Flutter frontend's my closet screen, including data storage, display, and advanced filtering. The current task involves UI/UX improvements, specifically screen transitions and logo integration. The engineer demonstrated persistence in overcoming environmental hurdles (e.g., Flutter installation, port conflicts, external access) and consistently provided detailed status updates and testing guides.

The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive AI-powered clothing analysis application. The initial task was to upgrade an existing MVP by replacing its basic clothing identification backend with advanced models: Mask R-CNN (via Detectron2) for masking and color detection, and MMFashion for attribute extraction.

Further detailed requirements for the AI output include:
1.  **Clothing Type Identification**: Classify the input image into specific clothing types (e.g., T-shirt, button shirt, jeans, cargo pants, shorts).
2.  **Clothing Style Classification**: Map the detected clothing item to one or more styles from a predefined closed list of 21 categories (e.g., Casual, Classy/Elegant, Business/Office Wear, Streetwear, Athleisure, Bohemian, Minimalist, Preppy, Grunge, Vintage/Retro, Y2K, Edgy/Punk, Goth, Chic, Romantic, Cottagecore, Artsy/Eclectic, Avant-Garde, Resort/Cruise Wear, Evening/Formal Wear). This classification should be inferred from the clothing type.
3.  **Color Percentages**: Provide a breakdown of colors present in the clothing item with their respective percentages (e.g., 50% white, 30% blue, 20% darkred).
4.  **Multi-Item Handling**: If multiple clothing items are detected in a single image, the system should prompt the user to select which item to analyze, then proceed with the analysis for the chosen item.

Subsequent enhancements involve integrating this AI analysis into the My Closet screen of the Flutter frontend:
1.  **Save AI Analysis**: Store the AI analysis results (clothing type, applicable styles, color percentages) for each clothing item saved in My Closet.
2.  **Display AI Analysis**: When a clothing item is selected/pressed, display its full AI analysis details at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Filtering**: Implement filtering capabilities on the My Closet screen based on:
    *   Colors contained in the clothes.
    *   Applicable styles (from the closed list).
    *   Clothing types (e.g., T-shirt, jeans).

Lastly, UI/UX improvements were requested for the Flutter app:
1.  **Smoother Screen Transitions**: Add animations between different screens.
2.  **App Logo Integration**: Display the DressApp logo on the login screen and as the overall app logo.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture: a React/Flutter frontend, a FastAPI/Flask backend, and a MongoDB database. The AI logic resides primarily within the backend.



-   : This new file encapsulates the core AI logic for clothing detection, color analysis, and attribute classification, designed to integrate Mask R-CNN and MMFashion. It also includes fallback mechanisms (e.g., YOLO) when advanced models are not fully installed.
-   : This new module was created to specifically implement the user's detailed requirements for clothing type identification, style classification based on the provided list, and handling of multiple detected items. It integrates with .
-   : This file likely serves as the entry point for the enhanced Flask/FastAPI backend, importing and orchestrating the  and  to expose the new AI functionalities via API endpoints.
-   : Contains new Python dependencies for Detectron2, MMFashion, and related libraries.
-   : This Flutter file manages API calls to the backend. It was updated to integrate with the new  endpoint and methods like  and  to handle the AI analysis and multiple item selection.
-   : The data model for clothing items in the My Closet feature. It was updated to include fields for storing the new AI analysis data (clothing type, applicable styles, color percentages).
-   : Manages local database operations for the Flutter app. It was updated to support the new schema changes required to persist the AI analysis data for each closet item.
-   : The Flutter UI for the My Closet screen. Major changes were made here to:
    -   Trigger AI analysis upon adding items.
    -   Display the stored AI analysis when an item is pressed.
    -   Implement the filtering UI and logic for colors, styles, and clothing types.
-   : Modified to exclude large files like , , and build artifacts, addressing Git LFS push issues.
-   : A new file to define custom page transition animations for smoother navigation in the Flutter app. (Currently being worked on).
-   : Existing widget for displaying the app logo, intended to be integrated into the login screen.
-   : The application logo image, confirmed to be present.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was immediately engaged in implementing UI/UX improvements for the Flutter application. This work stemmed from the user's explicit request to:
1.  **Add smoother transitions between screens with animations.**
2.  **Add the app logo on the login screen and as the logo of the app.**

The engineer has started by:
*   Exploring the existing Flutter project structure, specifically looking for login, authentication, and onboarding related files (, ).
*   Inspecting the  widget () to understand its current implementation.
*   Reviewing the main routing structure () to identify where page transitions could be applied.
*   Confirming the presence of the  image in .

As part of this, the engineer has already created a new file:
-   : This file is intended to define the custom page transition animations.

The very last action in the trajectory indicates that the engineer was about to create an animated logo widget that enhances the login experience, suggesting the next step would be implementing the logo display on the login screen and potentially integrating the page transitions into the  routing.
